Java Web Based platform with H2 database, MVC architecture, with use of Spring Boot, allows to perform CRUD operations.

Enables to rent a bike, contact another user, send a message, rate a product,
edit user and account details, includes filtering and search options, adding picuters.
Contains basic spring security settings, testing might be considered as one of the soft spots of this project

Most of the features were collaborative work, since this was first project for all of the members.
Commits unfortunately do not reflect actual input and effort of each and every member,
as most of the features were discussed, designed and implemented in pairs or more people only to be pushed to common project by one of us.
